# JavaScript

JavaScript is a loosely-typed client-side scripting language that executes in V8 Engine (attached to browsers and available in standalone release as Node.js). This programming language has one of most developed ecosystems which allows you to use JavaScript literally everywhere, starting from his nature - interacting with DOM Elements (HTML) to build interactive websites and user interfaces and other kinds of things such as Desktop/Mobile applications or even servers.

JavaScript implements ECMAScript Standards, which includes core features based on [ECMA-262 specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/ECMA-262.pdf) as well other features which are not based on ECMAScript standards.
