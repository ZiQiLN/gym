# The Gym

Generally, repository with my old/new experimental code when I was trying to check something, there are also some of my notes from notebooks but not at all.

## Notebooks

`notebooks` are digitalized version (actually not at all) of my real-world notebooks, probably there you can find a bit of useful informations that can help you solve a common problems or simplify learn something new.

### How to use Notebooks?

It's quite simple, at first you'll need to download software called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which will allow you to see a research graph of my notes contained in `notebook` folder. When you'll download that software you just need to import `notebook` folder in this repository and you can explore whole content that I have in peace.
