# The Gym

My repository with notes that I've used to learn a specific programming languages, my notes have some years but I think they are still actual and that can be useful for some newbie programmers so I've decide to rewrite a paper-version of them to digitalised version on GitHub with real code.

Quality of language used can be a bit poor because I hate translating polish language to english, but I'll try to keep this clean, in case of typos or some language mistakes feel free to open a PR.

#### Development of Gym repository

Repository currently is in early state, and it's development with GitFlow mechanics where main production branch is `master`, development is `develop` and feature branches are marked with `notebook/<lang>`.
