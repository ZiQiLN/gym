# @ZiQiLN/Research

Research is my repository dedicated for writing case-studies for used
technologies, building new sample projects to test something our and building
knowledge base of things that I've found and so on.

## Research

`research` are digitalized version (actually not at all) of my real-world notebooks, probably there you can find a bit of useful informations that can help you solve a common problems or simplify learn something new.

### How to use Research?

It's quite simple, at first you'll need to download software called
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which will allow you to see a research graph of
my notes contained in `research` folder. When you'll download that software you
just need to import `research` folder in this repository and you can explore
whole content that I have in peace. Behind Obisdian, any other [Foam Research]()
tool will work.
